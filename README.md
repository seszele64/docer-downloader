## Update 2024-11-16
currently the script might not be working on Firefox based browsers, I will be investigating the issue to work out some resolution, meanwhile:
fortunately the script works for Chrome based browsers (I updated [Installation info section](https://github.com/seszele64/docer-downloader/edit/main/README.md#installation-info) below)

## Docer Downloader Script

>Hey, I recommend using script version below, extension does not work on all files (because it uses native browser API which is stubborn and does not let many operations (like copying response of a request sent to you by docer site))

### Installation info

To make it work you need to:

1. Download and install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) add-on for your browser
2. Install [my script](https://gist.github.com/seszele64/011bd8a049d11fc9579d93afafa0367c/raw/Docer%20Document%20Downloader.user.js)
  - If you are using Firefox based browser (Firefox, Mullvad Browser, Librewolf etc.) the extension might not work you, I'm working on that :) 
  - If you are on Chrome based browser (Chrome, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera):
    1. Open extension settings page: ![how-to-open-manage-settings-page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c5a3552-4893-4a3b-9316-4af54195b669)
    2. Turn on developed mode: ![turn-on-developer-mode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/869ebbd1-f48d-42c4-a0fe-2bbc1900cdd7)

### Using extension

To utilize the Docer Downloader extension for downloading documents from Docer, please follow these instructions:

1. Head to docer site with document of preferance
2. Solve the captcha
3. Click the button on the top right to download the file (should work for all types of files)
